However it is currently hard to see this in the way we send data\nto hosted graphite (HG). For example, currently we have to drill into\n`aggregates.production.connector.gateway-operations.worldpay.live.gatewa-account-id`\n(which is fine) then into `authorise/authorise3ds`,\n`without-billing-address/with-billing-address` which makes it difficult to\ngraph the data we want. This PR sends the states a payment goes into which will\nhelp us graph the trends more easily. This is similar to what we send to splunk.",

        "body": "We want to be able to detect anomalous drops in successful live authorisations.\r\nIt is envisaged that we can do this by noticing trends in authorisation errors\r\nand successes. However it is currently hard to see this in the way we send data\r\nto hosted graphite (HG). For example, currently we have to drill into\r\n`aggregates.production.connector.gateway-operations.worldpay.live.gatewa-account-id`\r\n(which is fine) then into `authorise/authorise3ds`,\r\n`without-billing-address/with-billing-address` which makes it difficult to\r\ngraph the data we want. This PR sends the states a payment goes into which will\r\nhelp us graph the trends more easily. This is similar to what we send to splunk.\r\n\r\n## WHAT YOU DID\r\n_A brief description of the pull request:_\r\n\r\n## How to test\r\n\r\n- How should it be reviewed? \r\n- What feedback do you need? \r\n- If manual testing is needed, give suggested testing steps.\r\n\r\n## Code review checklist\r\n\r\n### Logging\r\n\r\n- [ ] only emit log lines at ERROR level which require immediate attention from a support engineer. These will trigger a zendesk alert.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- [ ] Updated README.md for any of the following ?\r\n\r\n* Introduced any new environment variables / removed existing environment variable\r\n* Added new API / updated existing API definition\r\n",

However it is currently hard to see this in the way we send data\nto hosted graphite (HG). For example, currently we have to drill into\n`aggregates.production.connector.gateway-operations.worldpay.live.gatewa-account-id`\n(which is fine) then into `authorise/authorise3ds`,\n`without-billing-address/with-billing-address` which makes it difficult to\ngraph the data we want. This PR sends the states a payment goes into which will\nhelp us graph the trends more easily. This is similar to what we send to splunk.",

It is current logged with default toString() method (which appears like `StripeAuthorisationFailedResponse@36e182ac`) in the upstream which is not helpful.\r\n",

It is current logged with default toString() method (which appears like `StripeAuthorisationFailedResponse@36e182ac`) in the upstream which is not helpful.",
